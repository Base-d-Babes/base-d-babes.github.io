# Base.d Babes — Canonical Artifact Surface

**Repository:** `base-d-babes.github.io`
**Live Site:** [https://base-d-babes.github.io/](https://base-d-babes.github.io/)

---

## Purpose of This Repository

This repository hosts the **canonical, static artifact surface** for the Base.d Babes project.

It is intentionally:

* **Static** (no execution logic)
* **Immutable** (content changes are deliberate and versioned)
* **Non-interactive** (no wallets, SDKs, or minting logic)

This site exists to preserve **canon, narrative, and reference materials** independent of any platform, marketplace, or protocol.

---

## What This Site Is

* The authoritative presentation of Archetypes
* The canonical home for essays, visual artifacts, and philosophy
* A stable reference point that can be cited, mirrored, or archived

---

## What This Site Is NOT

* A minting interface
* A Dapp
* A wallet-connected application
* A marketplace

All execution logic is intentionally separated.

---

## Minting — Read Carefully

**Primary minting does NOT occur on this site.**

Minting is conducted via the project’s **Execution Terminal**, which is linked from this site when active.

To mint:

1. Visit the canonical site to understand the Archetype and its context
2. Follow the link to the official Execution Terminal
3. Connect your wallet and mint via the provided interface

At no point is BaseScan knowledge required.

---

## Why This Architecture Exists

Platforms change.
Indexers fail.
Marketplaces deprecate features.

Canon must survive all of that.

Separating **artifact** from **execution** ensures:

* Long-term accessibility
* Reduced platform dependency
* Clear authority boundaries

---

## Community & Governance

Community discussion, proposals, and development coordination occur via:

* **GitHub Discussions** (this repository)
* Canonical ADR / RFC documents

No decisions are made in Discord threads, DMs, or private channels.

---

## Repositories of Interest

* **Canonical Site:** `base-d-babes.github.io`
* **Execution / Dapp (forthcoming):** TBD
* **Contracts & Infrastructure:** Linked as published

---

## Status

* Archetype #001 — *The Steward* — Released
* Execution Terminal — In development
* Archetype #002 — In formation

## Final Note

This project values:

* Restraint over spectacle
* Structure over speed
* Stewardship over hype

If you are here to understand, you are early.
