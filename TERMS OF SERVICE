# TERMS OF SERVICE: THE STEWARD

**1. THE ARTIFACT**
"Based_d Babes" and "The Steward" are artistic experiments in digital stewardship on the Base blockchain. By minting, you acknowledge that you are collecting a digital artifact (NFT), not a financial security, investment contract, or equity share.

**2. AS-IS PROVISION**
The Steward manages what endures, but technology is ephemeral. This interface and smart contract are provided "AS IS," without warranty of any kind. We are not liable for gas fees, failed transactions, browser errors, or the broader state of the Base network.

**3. CC0 PUBLIC DOMAIN**
The artwork for Archetype #001 (The Steward) is released under the CC0 1.0 Universal License.
* **You own the token.**
* **The world owns the image.**
We encourage you to reuse, remix, and rebuild upon this foundation.

**4. ALGORITHMIC GENERATION**
The artwork utilizes mixed human photography and AI-assisted environments. Artifacts may contain visual anomalies inherent to this process.

**5. JURISDICTION & COMPLIANCE**
You confirm you are not located in a sanctioned jurisdiction. You are responsible for ensuring your participation complies with the laws of your residency.
